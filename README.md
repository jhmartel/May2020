# May2020

Since March 2020 I have been working as labourer in Nesbitt's Greenhouse on Eardley Road, Aylmer, Quebec. During the day I'm on my feet following the gardeners.
Why is a gardener said to have a green thumb? Because they are always plugging their fingers in dirt: the only way to be great 
gardener is to be constantly gardening...

What have I been thinking about?
(1) From January--May 2020 I spent much energy in learning of church history (Ante and Post-Nicean fathers) and especially the eclessial orthodoxy
of the Eastern Orthodox Church... Yet I understand now that in fact I desire Scriptural Orthodoxy, especially the Masoretic OT texts
and the Textus Receptus (Koine Greek) NT....

(2) Electric Universe: 
(2.1) Preliminary research on Black Holes and fallacies in Einstein's Special Relativity.
(2.1.1) If Elon Musk is indeed sending 1000+ satellites into space, then there is wide testing (either validation or denial) of Einstein's
SR principles... Where is the evidence? Where is the analysis??

(3) Crothers' examples of interchanging the coordinate singularities with the Kreitschmann curvature singularities.
(3.1) Does the Intermediate Value Theorem still apply, and must the ``extensions" in fact be orientation-reversing between the coordinate- and curvature- singularities?

(4) Investing in metal detector. Hobby, but Vanessa is not impressed... Am I a child? Or do i want to ``ilve" as field technician already??

(5) Weber's formula and Assis: there is an experiment to be performed: modified Millikan Oil Drop Experiment [https://youtu.be/tKhsU01LxZg?t=159]
